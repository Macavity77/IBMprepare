Behavior Question:

1. How did you become interested in a position with our IBM ream?
Big picture:
IBM is a poineer in internet technology.  
Such Cloud service. Key to the future technongy.
IBM has already become one of the poinner in this area.
So, from those perspectiflc, I would really like to explore 
future career opportunity with IBM

Personally and more precisaly:
I had heard my friends' experience at the same internship program at IBM
He shared his experience of how he interact with
engineer... and coding... and review...
How much he learned during this process.

Being an intern, can help...

Maybe one day,
help IBM keep poinner...

2. Area of studies and experience make you a good candidate
My major is in Computer Engineering. I has knowlede from the most
basic data structer and algorithms to some detailed area.

Such as database, back-end programming(multi-thread and mutliprocssing),
Android App, and basic web design.

I progamming mainly in Java, some in Pyhton, for database use MYSQL
. For web framework, I used Django based on python

I think those make me qualify to be an intern at IBM

3. New technology
Bid data using Hadoop based on docker.
Pros:
Can make fully use of enoumous amont of data.
By using multiple cluster, can accelerate the calculating process
Can help people/ company make desicion on prevoise expeiernce.

Cons:
1. Security reason (recently Facebook)
2. The validality of the data source, might leads to wrong forecast
3. Limit: some area cannot be forcast based on previous data

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
